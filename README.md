# Instrumentdetection

Welcome to our project on Instrument Classification! In today's digital age, the ability to automatically recognize musical instruments in audio files holds significant importance for various applications in music technology, such as music recommendation systems, digital music libraries, and educational tools. This project aims to harness the power of machine learning to accurately identify different musical instruments from sound clips.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting specific musical instruments within audio tracks. We'll be utilizing the IRMAS dataset, which is specifically designed for instrument recognition in musical mixtures. By the end of this project, we aim to:

Implement a robust model that can classify audio clips into categories based on the instrument being played.
Explore and compare different feature extraction techniques and their effectiveness in improving classification accuracy.
